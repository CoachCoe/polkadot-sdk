title: Add storage bounds for pallet `staking`
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    This is part of #6289 and necessary for the Asset Hub migration.

    Building on the observations and suggestions from #255 .

    **Changes**

    - Add `MaxInvulnerables` to bound `Invulnerables` Vec -> `BoundedVec`.
        - Set to constant 20 in the pallet (must be >= 17 for backward compatibility of runtime `westend`).
    - Add `MaxDisabledValidators` to bound `DisabledValidators` Vec -> `BoundedVec`
        - Set to constant 100 in the pallet (it should be <= 1/3 * `MaxValidatorsCount` according to the current disabling strategy)
    - Remove `ErasStakers` and `ErasStakersClipped` (see #433 )
        - They were deprecated in v14 and could have been removed since staking era 1504 (now it's > 1600)
        - Completing the task from #5986
    - Use `MaxExposurePageSize` to bound  `ErasStakersPaged` mapping to exposure pages: each `ExposurePage.others` Vec is turned into a `WeakBoundedVec` to allow easy and quick changes to this bound
    - Add `MaxBondedEras` to bound `BondedEras` Vec -> `BoundedVec`
        - Set to `BondingDuration::get() + 1` everywhere to include both time interval endpoints in [`current_era - BondingDuration::get()`, `current_era`]
    - Add `MaxRewardPagesPerValidator` to bound `ClaimedRewards` Vec of pages -> `WeakBoundedVec`
        - Set to constant 20 in the pallet. The vector of pages is now a `WeakBoundedVec` to allow easy and quick changes to this parameter
    - Remove `MaxValidatorsCount` optional storage item to add `MaxValidatorsCount` mandatory config parameter
        -  Using it to to bound `EraRewardPoints.individual` BTreeMap -> `BoundedBTreeMap`;
        -  Set to dynamic parameter in runtime westend so that changing it should not require migrations for it

    **TO DO**
    Slashing storage items will be bounded in another PR.
